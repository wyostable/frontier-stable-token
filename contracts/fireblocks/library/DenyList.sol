 * @notice The Denylist Service establishes an on-chain Denylist for the Fireblocks ecosystem of smart contracts. It

 * {IAccessRegistry}. Thereby allowing other contracts in the system to check if an address is allowed to participate.
 *
 * @dev Denylist Service features.
 *
 * The Denylist Service contract Role Based Access Control employs the following roles:
 *
 * - UPGRADER_ROLE (via {AccessListUpgradeable})
 * - PAUSER_ROLE (via {AccessListUpgradeable})
 * - CONTRACT_ADMIN_ROLE (via {AccessListUpgradeable})
